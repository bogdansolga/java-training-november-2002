Abstract classes - modelling an abstract object / concept, from the real world. Examples:
- fruit
- electronic product
- money
- ticket
- car

The reasons:
- defining common behavior / properties for all the extending classes
- having an hierarchy for them --> being able to treat them generically
- treating objects from the implementing classes uniformly
- having a simple way to enforce the implementation of functionalities from the parent (abstract) class
